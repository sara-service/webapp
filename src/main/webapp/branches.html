				<li class="text-primary">
					"<strong>Publish full history</strong>" will publish the
					<strong>entire history</strong> of a branch as-is.
					This is the <strong>most useful format</strong> for others
					to continue working with your project,
					and thus the <strong>recommended option</strong>.
					Note that this will publish the entire project history
					of the selected branch, including anything
					you might have excluded on previous publications.
					This is the only option that <strong>retains the commit IDs</strong>,
					keeping your work fully replicable.
				</li>
				<li class="text-warning">
					"<strong>Publish abbreviated history</strong>" will publish only
					the <strong>significant points</strong> of a branch's history.
					Only merge commits and
					commits that have been tagged with <code>git tag</code>
					will be retained in the abbreviated history,
					as well as the HEAD revision of the branch.
					This option will <strong>change the commit IDs,
					reducing the replicability</strong> of your work,
					but mention the original commit ID in the commit message.
					The full history will be archived non-publicly.
					This is the recommended option
					<strike>if your development process is so shoddy
					that you are ashamed of it</strike>
					if you need to hide parts of your development process.
				</li>
				<li class="text-danger">
					"<strong>Publish latest version only</strong>" will publish only
					the HEAD revision of the branch.
					If you have previously archived this project,
					the previously published version(s) will be listed
					as previous commit(s).
					This option will change the commit ID,
					but mention the original commit ID in the commit message.
					The full history will be archived non-publicly.
					This option is <strong>not recommended</strong>
					unless you don't have any other options.
				</li>
				<li>
					"<strong>Archive only, don't publish</strong>"
					will not publish anything (obviously),
					but will non-publicly archive the full history of a branch.
					This is suitable for data that you want to (or have to) keep private.
					Please note that this is not suitable for highly sensitive data;
					in particular, it must never be used for medical data!
				</li>
				<li class="text-muted">
					"<strong>Ignore, do not archive</strong>"
					will completely ignore a branch.
					It will not be present in the archive at all,
					and will thus not be preserved.
					If you delete it from GitLab,
					it will be gone for good.
					Choose this option for any highly private data
					that you are storing on GitLab
					(in violation of its terms of service).
